Description: suite of utilities for comparing genomic features
 The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as
 finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are largely
 based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM. Using
 BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer complicated
 research questions by streaming several BEDTools together.
 .
 The groupBy utility is distribued in the filo package.
